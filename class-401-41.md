# Read: 41 - Intent Filters

<hr>

# Allowing Other Apps to Start Your Activity

* If your app can perform an action that might be useful from another app, your app should be prepared to respond to action requests by specifying the appropriate intent filter in your activity.

* To allow other apps to start your activity in this way, you need to add an `<intent-filter>` element in your manifest file for the corresponding `<activity>` element.

* When your app is installed on a device, the system identifies your intent filters and adds the information to an internal catalog of intents supported by all installed apps. When an app calls `startActivity()` or `startActivityForResult()`, with an implicit intent, the system finds which activity (or activities) can respond to the intent.

## Add an Intent Filter:

* In order to properly define which intents your activity can handle, each intent filter you add should be as specific as possible in terms of the type of action and data the activity accepts.

EX:

```xml
<activity android:name="ShareActivity">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND"/>
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
        <data android:mimeType="text/plain"/>
        <data android:mimeType="image/*"/>
    </intent-filter>
</activity>

```

## Handle the Intent in Your Activity:

* In order to decide what action to take in your activity, you can read the Intent that was used to start it.

* As your activity starts, call `getIntent()` to retrieve the Intent that started the activity. You can do so at any time during the lifecycle of the activity, but you should generally do so during early callbacks such as `onCreate()` or `onStart()`.

For example:

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    setContentView(R.layout.main);

    // Get the intent that started this activity
    Intent intent = getIntent();
    Uri data = intent.getData();

    // Figure out what to do based on the intent type
    if (intent.getType().indexOf("image/") != -1) {
        // Handle intents with image data ...
    } else if (intent.getType().equals("text/plain")) {
        // Handle intents with text ...
    }
}

```

## Return a Result:

If you want to return a result to the activity that invoked yours, simply call `setResult()` to specify the result code and result Intent. When your operation is done and the user should return to the original activity, call `finish()` to close (and destroy) your activity. 
For example:

```java
// Create intent to deliver some kind of result data
Intent result = new Intent("com.example.RESULT_ACTION", Uri.parse("content://result_uri"));
setResult(Activity.RESULT_OK, result);
finish();
```
