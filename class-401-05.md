# Read: Linked Lists

## Big O’s :
 role in algorithm efficiency is to describe the Worst Case of efficiency an algorithm can have in performing it’s job. It specifically looks at the factors mentioned above, which we often refer to as Space and Time. In order to analyze these limiting factors, we should consider 4 Key Areas for analysis:

- Input Size
- Units of Measurement
- Orders of Growth
- Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case

## What is a Linked List
A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

There are there types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly and circuler.

## Parts of a linked list:

* A linked list is made up of a series of nodes, which are the elements of the list.
* The starting point of the list is a reference to the first node, which is referred to as the `head`.
* Each node has just two parts:
    1. data.
    2. a reference to the next node.

> *A node only knows about what data it contains, and who its neighbor is.*


*A good rule of thumb for remember the characteristics of linked lists is this:*

> *a linked list is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element.*
