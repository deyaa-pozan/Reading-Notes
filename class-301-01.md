# What is a Component?

A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

# Characteristics of Components

* Extensible 

* Encapsulated 

* Independent

# Advantages

* Ease of deployment

# What is props short for?

is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

# Using Props in React

* Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)

* Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props

* Finally, render the Props Data

# What is the flow of props?

But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)
