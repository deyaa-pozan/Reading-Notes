# Read: Stacks & Queues

# What is a Stack:

* A stack is a data structure that consists of `Nodes`. Each `Node` references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

* **Common terminology for a stack is**

* `Push` - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
* `Pop` - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. ***When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.***
* `Top` - This is the top of the stack.
* `Peek` - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. ***When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.***
* `IsEmpty` - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.


* ***Stacks follow these concepts:***

`FILO`
**F**irst **I**n **L**ast **O**ut

> This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

`LIFO`
**L**ast **I**n **F**irst **O**ut

> This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.


# Stack Implementation:

## top

* the topmost item is denoted as the `top`. When you `push` something to the stack, it becomes the new `top`.
* When you `pop` something from the stack, you `pop` the current `top` and set the next `top` as `top.next`


## push

* Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an `O(1)` operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.

* When adding a Node, you `push` it into the stack by assigning it as the new `top`, with its next property equal to the original `top`.

*Here is the pseudocode to push a value onto a stack:*

```
ALOGORITHM push(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   node.next <-- Top
   top <-- Node
```


## pop

* Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the `top`. When conducting a `pop`, the `top` Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the `top` Node is returned to the user.

* Typically, you would check `isEmpty` before conducting a `pop`. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

*Here is the pseudocode for a pop*

```
ALGORITHM pop()
// INPUT <-- No input
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   Node temp <-- top
   top <-- top.next
   temp.next <-- null
   return temp.value
```

## peek

* When conducting a `peek`, you will only be inspecting the `top` Node of the stack.

Typically, you would check `isEmpty` before conducting a `peek`. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

*Here is the pseudocode for a peek*

```
ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   return top.value

```

## isEmpty

*Here is the pseudocode for isEmpty*

```
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return top = NULL
```

# What is a Queue

* **Common terminology for a queue is**

* `Enqueue` - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
* `Dequeue` - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. ***If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.***
* `Front` - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
* `Rear` - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
* `Peek` - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. ***If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.***
* `IsEmpty` - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.


***Queues follow these concepts:***

`FIFO`
**F**irst **I**n **F**irst **O**ut

> This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

`LILO`
**L**ast **I**n **L**ast **O**ut

> This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.


# Queue implementation

## Enqueue 

When you add an item to a queue, you use the `enqueue` action. This is done with an `O(1)` operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

*Here is the pseudocode for the enqueue method:*

```
ALGORITHM enqueue(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add to queue (will be wrapped in Node internally)
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   rear.next <-- node
   rear <-- node
```


## Dequeue 

When you remove an item from a queue, you use the `dequeue` action. This is done with an `O(1)` operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the `front` Node of the queue.

Typically, you would check `isEmpty` before conducting a `dequeue`. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

*Here is the pseudocode for the dequeue method:*

```
ALGORITHM dequeue()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the removed Node
// EXCEPTION if queue is empty

   Node temp <-- front
   front <-- front.next
   temp.next <-- null

   return temp.value
```

## Peek

When conducting a `peek`, you will only be inspecting the `front` Node of the queue.

Typically, you want to check `isEmpty` before conducting a `peek`. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

*Here is the pseudocode for a peek*

```
ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the front Node in Queue
// EXCEPTION if Queue is empty

   return front.value
```
