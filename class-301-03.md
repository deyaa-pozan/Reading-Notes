What does .map() return?
The map() function is most commonly used for rendering a list of data to the DOM. To use the map() function, attach it to an array you want to iterate over. The map() function expects a callback as the argument and executes it once for each element in the array.

If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React
The map() also used function to iterate over an array of data in JSX. You can attach the map() method to the array and pass a callback function that gets called for each iteration. When rendering the User component, pass a unique value to the key prop

identifies.

Keys help React identify which items have changed (added/removed/re-ordered)

What is the spread operator?
The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments. The spread operator can do. Copying an array. Concatenating or combining arrays. Using Math functions. Using an array as arguments. Adding an item to a list. Adding to state in React. Combining objects. Converting Node List to an array.

Example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays
const myArray = [🤪,🐻,🎌]

const yourArray = [🙂,🤗,🤩]

const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]

console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩
