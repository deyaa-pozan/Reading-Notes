# The code I’m still ashamed of
## *"As developers, we are often one of the last lines of defense against potentially dangerous and unethical practices."*
>  I was very touched by this line of the article, I do not want to have a single line of code that I will regret writing later.
>  
One of the most important reasons that prompted me to get involved in the field of software development,
is to provide applicable and practical solutions to the problems of my community and problems related to the goals of sustainable development.
First of all, before I call myself a developer, I am a member of this world and this society.
So when I write any line of code, I must put this idea in front of my eyes, what is its impact, what is its goal and what is the purpose behind it.
Perhaps we will be exposed to a situation of engaging in a project that violates my principles or positions despite the possibility of a large financial return;
but the truth - that the goal remains, not the material - we will face many difficulties if you do not carry the same motive and principles that started all this,
there will come a time when you will lose all This is because you aimlessly followed the material that will inevitably have an end point at some point.
# Ethical dilemma of self driving cars
> This quote from this article points out the main dilemma of the case
> 
"....This revelation suggests the issue isn't solely about ethics, but rather it's also about control. People think ethically in principle, 
but in practice they behave more selfishly,especially if they are not in command of a situation.
Azim Shariff, an associate professor of psychology and social behaviour at the University of California in Irvine and co-author of the study,
says this control factor is fuelling a double standard in how people view themselves and machines......"
#### First of all, I want to mention that just by coincidence, this is exactly what was the reason behind my interest in artificial intelligence.
Three years ago, I attended a scientific conference, the highlight of which was a session entitled "Artificial Intelligence is a double-edged sword", as I remember.
In that session, the example of self-driving was discussed, and many studies and statistics that support the idea of ​​its implementation were mentioned.
I also have an academic scientific background in the field of roads and numbers, as many questions run through my mind
As a result, on a personal level, this is my position on this issue:
- Detailed here is the human factor and acceptance, detachment and discussion of the idea objectively in reality supports the idea.

- The fact that every technological revolution has been met with outright rejection and non-acceptance cannot be obliterated until it gradually develops into the reality that what results from these revolutions is at the present time a necessity and a basic need for living. It is no different with this case.

- It must be taken into account that there are two percentages for the study, the first is the percentage of accidents, and the other is the percentage of damage from the accidents that occur, and in the event that these percentages are reduced, this means the effectiveness of the application of this technology.
