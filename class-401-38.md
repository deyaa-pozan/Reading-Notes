# What is Amazon SNS?

Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a managed service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers (also known as producers and consumers). Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by sending messages to a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel. Clients can subscribe to the SNS topic and receive published messages using a supported endpoint type, such as Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, Amazon SQS, AWS Lambda, HTTP, email, mobile push notifications, and mobile text messages (SMS).

***You can use the following services with Amazon SNS:***

* `Amazon SQS` offers a secure, durable, and available hosted queue that lets you integrate and decouple distributed software systems and components. 

* `AWS Lambda` enables you to build applications that respond quickly to new information. Run your application code in Lambda functions on highly available compute infrastructure.

* `AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)` helps you securely control access to AWS resources for your users. Use IAM to control who can use your Amazon SNS topics (authentication), what topics they can use, and how they can use them (authorization).
