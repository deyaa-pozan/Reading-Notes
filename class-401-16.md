# Read: 16 - Spring Authentication


# Authentication and Access Control:

* Application security boils down to two more or less independent problems: `authentication` (who are you?) and `authorization` (what are you allowed to do?). Sometimes people say `“access control”` instead of `"authorization"`.

* Spring Security has an architecture that is designed to separate authentication from authorization and has strategies and extension points for both.

## Authentication

* The main strategy interface for authentication is AuthenticationManager, which has only one method:

```
public interface AuthenticationManager {

  Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication)
    throws AuthenticationException;
}
```

An `AuthenticationManager` can do one of 3 things in its `authenticate()` method:

* Return an `Authentication` (normally with `authenticated=true`) if it can verify that the input represents a valid principal.

* Throw an `AuthenticationException` if it believes that the input represents an invalid principal.

* Return `null` if it cannot decide.


* The most commonly used implementation of `AuthenticationManager` is `ProviderManager`, which delegates to a chain of `AuthenticationProvider` instances.
* An `AuthenticationProvider` is a bit like an `AuthenticationManager`, but it has an extra method to allow the caller to query whether it supports a given Authentication type:

```
public interface AuthenticationProvider {

	Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication)
			throws AuthenticationException;

	boolean supports(Class<?> authentication);
}
```

The `Class<?>` argument in the `supports()` method is really `Class<? extends Authentication>` (it is only ever asked if it supports something that is passed into the `authenticate()` method). A `ProviderManager` can support multiple different authentication mechanisms in the same application by delegating to a chain of `AuthenticationProviders`. If a `ProviderManager` does not recognize a particular Authentication instance type, it is skipped.

# Authorization or Access Control

* Once authentication is successful, we can move on to authorization, and the core strategy here is AccessDecisionManager. 
* There are three implementations provided by the framework and all three delegate to a chain of AccessDecisionVoter instances, a bit like the ProviderManager delegates to AuthenticationProviders.

An AccessDecisionVoter considers an Authentication (representing a principal) and a secure Object, which has been decorated with ConfigAttributes:
```
boolean supports(ConfigAttribute attribute);

boolean supports(Class<?> clazz);

int vote(Authentication authentication, S object,
        Collection<ConfigAttribute> attributes);
```

## Web Security

Spring Security in the web tier (for UIs and HTTP back ends) is based on Servlet `Filters`, so it is helpful to first look at the role of `Filters` generally.

## Method Security

As well as support for securing web applications, Spring Security offers support for applying access rules to Java method executions. For Spring Security, this is just a different type of “protected resource”. For users, it means the access rules are declared using the same format of ConfigAttribute strings (for example, roles or expressions) but in a different place in your code. The first step is to enable method security — for example, in the top level configuration for our application:
```
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(securedEnabled = true)
public class SampleSecureApplication {
}
```

Then we can decorate the method resources directly:
```
@Service
public class MyService {

  @Secured("ROLE_USER")
  public String secure() {
    return "Hello Security";
  }

}
```

This example is a service with a secure method. If Spring creates a `@Bean` of this type, it is proxied and callers have to go through a security interceptor before the method is actually executed. If access is denied, the caller gets an `AccessDeniedException` instead of the actual method result.

There are other annotations that you can use on methods to enforce security constraints, notably `@PreAuthorize` and `@PostAuthorize`, which let you write expressions containing references to method parameters and return values, respectively.

# Spring Auth Cheat Sheet

## Step 1: set up a user model and repo

## Step 2: create a controller for that model

## Step 3: UserDetailsServiceImpl implements UserDetailsService

gets a User from the database by username (make sure your repository has the method to make this easy!)

## Step 4: ApplicationUser implements UserDetails

use IntelliJ to implement the methods; make the boolean ones all return true

## Step 5: WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter

- has a UserDetailsService
- passwordEncoder bean
- configure AuthManagerBuilder
    - `auth.userDetailsService(userDetailsService).passwordEncoder(passwordEncoder());`
- configure HttpSecurity
    - cors? csrf?
    - matchers for URLs that are allowed
        - ensure that login and signup URLs allowed; also consider homepage etc.
    - formLogin with login page set up
    - logout

```
    @Override
    @Bean
    public AuthenticationManager authenticationManagerBean() throws Exception {
        return super.authenticationManagerBean();
    }
```

## Step 6: registration page
- create it w/ form
- ensure it posts to a route your controller is ready for
- check it's saving in the DB
```
    // maybe autologin?
    Authentication authentication = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(newUser, null, new ArrayList<>());
    SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication);
```

## Step 7: login page
- create it w/ form
- ensure it posts to the route you specified in web config
- try it out!
- add to a template w/ things about the Principal
