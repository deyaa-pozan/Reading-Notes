# SOLID: The First 5 Principles of Object Oriented Design:

> SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob).

## SOLID stands for:

- *S* - Single-responsiblity Principle
- *O* - Open-closed Principle
- *L* - Liskov Substitution Principle
- *I* - Interface Segregation Principle
- *D* - Dependency Inversion Principle

#### ______________________________________________________

## Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP):

> *A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.*

## Open-Closed Principle:

> *Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.*

* This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.

## Liskov Substitution Principle:

> *Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.*

* This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

## Interface Segregation Principle:

> *A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.*

## Dependency Inversion Principle:

> *Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.*

## Conclusion:

* You were presented with the five principles of SOLID Code. 
* Projects that adhere to SOLID principles can be shared with collaborators, extended, modified, tested, and refactored with fewer complications.
