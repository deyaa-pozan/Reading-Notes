State and Props
What are props? Props is short for properties and they are used to pass data between React components. React’s data flow between components is uni-directional (from parent to child only).

How do you pass data with props? Here is an example of how data can be passed by using props:

class ParentComponent extends Component {
render() {
return (

);
} }

const ChildComponent = (props) => {
return

{props.name}

; }; Firstly, we need to define/get some data from the parent component and assign it to a child component’s “prop” attribute.
“Name” is a defined prop here and contains text data. Then we can pass data with props like we’re giving an argument to a function:
const ChildComponent = (props) => {
// statements }; And finally, we use dot notation to access the prop data and render it:

return

{props.name}

;
Rebuilt with React?
React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.

As one of the oldest React libraries, React-Bootstrap has evolved and grown alongside React, making it an excellent choice as your UI foundation.

Bootstrap at its core?
Built with compatibility in mind, we embrace our bootstrap core and strive to be compatible with the world’s largest UI ecosystem.

Accessible by default?
The React component model gives us more control over form and function of each component.

Each component is implemented with accessibility in mind. The result is a set of accessible-by-default components, over what is possible from plain Bootstrap.

What Is React?
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
