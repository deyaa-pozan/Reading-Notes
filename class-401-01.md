# Java Basics

## Variables
You've already learned that objects store their state in fields. However, the Java programming language also uses the term "variable" as well. This section discusses this relationship, plus variable naming rules and conventions, basic data types (primitive types, character strings, and arrays), default values, and literals.

## Operators
This section describes the operators of the Java programming language. It presents the most commonly-used operators first, and the less commonly-used operators last. Each discussion includes code samples that you can compile and run.

## Expressions, Statements, and Blocks
Operators may be used in building expressions, which compute values; expressions are the core components of statements; statements may be grouped into blocks. This section discusses expressions, statements, and blocks using example code that you've already seen.

## Control Flow Statements
This section describes the control flow statements supported by the Java programming language. It covers the decisions-making, looping, and branching statements that enable your programs to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.

## Compiling
Compiling is the process of transforming a high level language into a low level langauge. A high level langauge is closer to English. A low level language is closer to what the computer understands.

Java is much more than just a big set of grammar rules. Java has a standard Application Programming Interface â€”a huge library consisting of over 4,000 classes, each with its own functionality, its own limitations, and its own rules for effective use.
