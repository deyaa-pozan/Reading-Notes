React and Forms
React Docs - Forms
When an element is controlled by both the setState() method and the user input it is refereed to as a controlled component.

On my opinion I think it is relative to the usage of the form, if I need the input to be rendered instantly I would use the onChange attribute to change the state by binding it with a method, and vars versa.

We can target the input value using the event object and pass it to method to either change the state or to use it for any other purpose.

The Conditional (Ternary) Operator
The Ternary operator is a shorter and easier way to write a conditional statement in Javascript.

We can rewrite the following conditional statement using the Ternary operator : <

if (x === y) {
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}
Which would be refactored to :

x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
Things I want to know more about
I want to know more about the Function.bind() method and why do we use it in ReactJS.

I want to know more about the the styling of a form using React Bootstrap.
