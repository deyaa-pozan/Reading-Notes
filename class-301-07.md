# What Google Learned About Teams
There is no "I" in a "TEAM" but thats not the whole story, if you put a lot of people togather in a room and tell them to build a project, you would propably end up with a mess, this is also applied on any team whether it is a team of five,twenty or hundred of people it will stay the same.

Google wanted to learn what makes a team considered to be a "Perfect team" and thats what they did back in 2012, The Analyticss division at google started Project Aristotle



The division found out some interesting things, no matter your personalties differences in the team there are five key characteristics of the perfect team and they are :

* Psychological safety: Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.

* Dependability: Everyone completes quality work on time.

* Structure and clarity: Everyone knows what their specific expectations are.These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.

* Meaning: Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).

* Impact: Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.



# REST
Roy fielding is an amazing guy with the great idea of HTTP which is the base for the communication between different resources.

When someone start programming how a group of machines communicate with each other, they focus on the quality of communication between small groups instead of a huge poorly optimized language of communication, this results of the need for one way to communicate with all different machines in the world.

the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the world wide web.

## Different HTTP methods :

* GET : used to retrieve data from systems.
* POST : used to send data to the servers.
* PUT : used to replace data.
* PATCH : used to update data.
